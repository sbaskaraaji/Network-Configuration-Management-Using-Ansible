# Automate Network Provisioning on Private Cloud Network Architecture Using Ansible

Ansible as agentless open source IT automation engine can really helped to orchestrate advanced workflows. This tool have been used on many different cases, wether on programing or networking. In this study case, there are:

* IOS Routers
* Virtual Switches
* CloudStack
* Ansible

That going to build as an environment, Ansible will act as a control node. The goal of this project is to complete network configuration L2, L3 and little bit of VXLAN, on IOS Routers and Virtual Switches that will act as a managed node, using Ansible Playbook.
